# Overview

## What is project Prague?

Project Prague is an SDK (software development kit) that allows you to create NUI (natural user interface) expereinces based on hand gesture input. We provide an API (application programming interface) enabling you to easily design and code up your own customized hand gestures and integrate them into your applications.

The building blocks of a gesture are hand poses and hand motions. We allow you to define any hand pose or hand motion you like using simple constraints built with plain language. You can string a sequence of hand poses and hand motions together to create a gesture. Once your gesture is defined and registered with our runtime, we will notify you whenever we detect that your user has performed the gesture with their hand. You can use handle this detection event in You can select an action to assign in response. At this poiny you can run the desired logic to respond to the detected gesture.

Using project Prague, you can enable your users to intuitively control music and videos, bookmark and like web content, send emojis on IM (instant messaging) applications, interact with a digital assistants, create and run PowerPoint slideshows, maipulate three-dimensional objects and play games using their hands alone.
