<!--#Set up Project Prague

To get Project Prague running on your machine you will need to:

1. Purchase an [Intel (R) RealSense (TM) SR300 camera](https://click.intel.com/intelrealsense-developer-kit-featuring-sr300.html). Connect the camera to a USB 3.0 port. Please avoid using a charging port, use an "SS" port instead. Place the camera below your computer's monitor, directed at your face, as illustrated in the image below:

1. Install Project Prague runtime from [the official url](http://aka.ms/gestures/setup). The installation will create shortcuts on your desktop pointing to our compiled samples. When installation completes, a window titled "Microsoft Gestures Service" will be launched. This is our our dashboard, displaying information about gesture and pose detection in real-time. Make sure that your fingers are detected successfully, as demonstrated below:

1. When installation completes, you will have an environment variable named "MicrosoftGesturesInstallDir". This variable points at the directory where all our assemblies are located. You can use it to reference our assemblies from your code.-->
